        Between the second and third terms of my second year of university, I dedicated a moderate amount of time to a spreadsheet 
        containing unique words for as many trigrams as possible.</span></p>

        I keep finding small excuses to learn how to use Sheets better. It&rsquo;s no VLOOKUP, but this sheet features
        INDIRECTs, ADDRESSes, intra-sheet HYPERLINKs, and conditional formatting, which already puts it, from a technical standpoint, in the top half of all the sheets I&rsquo;'ve ever made.</span></p>
    <p class="space"></p>
    <p class="text"><span>
        Highlights include DODE<u>CAH</u>EDRON surrounded by words less than half its length, 
        the full column corresponding to <u>REA</u> through <u>REZ</u>, 
        and the extremely long shortlist of unplaced words.</span></p>

        My stats section tells me that as of writing this sentence I have filled in about 20% of all trigrams. Not bad!</span></p>
