        Gartic Cellulart is a Chromium/Gecko extension for the browser-based drawing game <a href="https://garticphone.com/">Gartic Phone</a>,
        providing additional functions that integrate with the base game mechanically and stylistically.</span></p>

        Cellulart was written entirely in vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, 
        and makes use of lots of different components of the Chromium environment. 
        For instance,
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API">Web Workers</a>
        (background scripts) keep the interface responsive while pushing heavy computation to background threads, 
        and the structure of
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket">WebSockets</a> 
        was studied in order to intercept outgoing traffic.</span></p>
    <p class="space"></p>
    <p class="text"><span class="c8">
        I was (and still am) hesitant to migrate to Webpack or similar project / build managers, 
        so Cellulart uses minified packages provided by 
        <a href="https://www.jsdelivr.com">jsdelivr</a> 
        to sidestep external dependencies.</span></p>

    <p class="centered"><span class="inline-images"><img
        alt="A screenshot of the Geom and Debug functionalities being used" 
        replace src="./images/image2.png"
        class="inline-image-content"
        title=""></span></p>

    <p class="text"><span>
        Reformatting the code multiple times was a rewarding experience because I was able to visibly see 
        the quality of my code improving. The project also acclimated me to the feeling of vulnerability that comes with 
        <a href="https://github.com/Kuixz/gartic-cellulart">making open-source</a>
        an unfinished product.</span></p>

    <p class="text"><span>Get the extension for
        <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/u/1/detail/pjeenahidnpjaajbiidagnackjdhnlam">Chrome</a>
        or <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/gartic-cellulart">Firefox</a></span></p>

        P.S. As thanks for visiting my website, here&rsquo;s a fun fact: 
        "Satellite" is not just the name of the module that locks and unlocks the "cheat" modules.
        It is also the passphrase.</span></p>
