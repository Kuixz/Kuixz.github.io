        Snowsweeper is a Godot-based variant of Minesweeper with elements inspired by factory games. It tends to go on and off the backburner a lot, and is still in an incomplete (alpha) stage.

        I had intended to make a small Minesweeper app to put on my personal statement as a small achievement. 
        But then the idea to add in factory elements came along. 
        So for four or five consecutive term breaks I have promised myself that I would finish Snowsweeper before the next term period.

        Yeah, no.</span></p>

        Well, at least progress has been made. The idea has been with me in periods of low progress and low motivation, 
        through the ups and downs. In fact, I switched everything to Godot around January of 2024 in response to Unity's pricing changes. The perks of indie, I guess.</span></p>

        Efforts have been... not consistent, but at least recurrent. 
        By the time I graduate I will definitely have finished Snowsweeper. Slowly but surely. 
        I promise. I hope.</span></p>
